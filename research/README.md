# Research

Cross-project research artifacts — landscape assessments, technology evaluations, council debates, and design analyses that inform multiple projects or governance decisions.

## What Goes Here

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Landscape assessment** | Ecosystem maps spanning multiple tools/projects |
| **Technology evaluation** | Deep dives into external tools or standards |
| **Council debate transcript** | Structured multi-agent debates with verdicts |
| **Design analysis** | Cross-cutting architectural analysis |

## What Doesn't Go Here

| Instead | Where |
|---------|-------|
| Project-specific reviews | `projects/*/reviews/` |
| Governance audits | `reviews/` |
| Granular implementation design | Project repo (not the blackboard) |

## Naming Convention
