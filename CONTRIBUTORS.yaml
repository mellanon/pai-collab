# pai-collab — Contributor Trust Zones
#
# Repo-level trust zones for all contributors to the shared blackboard.
# See TRUST-MODEL.md for the full trust model and defense layers.
#
# Zones:
#   maintainer — Repository steward. Can promote/demote, merge, modify SOPs and trust model.
#   trusted    — Promoted contributor. Content bypasses Layers 4-6. Cannot modify governance.
#   untrusted  — Default for all new contributors. Content triggers full scanning (Layers 4-6).
#
# Project-level trust is defined separately in each project's PROJECT.yaml.
# A contributor can be project maintainer without elevated repo-level trust.
