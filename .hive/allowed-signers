# pai-collab allowed-signers — Cryptographic Trust Anchor
#
# This file maps operators to their Ed25519 SSH public keys.
# It is the source of truth for commit signature verification.
#
# Format: <email> <key-type> <public-key>
#
# Maintenance rules:
#   - Only maintainers can merge changes to this file
#   - Adding an operator: they submit a signed PR with their key
#     (the signed commit proves key ownership)
#   - Removing an operator: maintainer removes the line
#   - Key rotation: operator submits signed PR with new key
#
# Verification:
#   git config gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile .hive/allowed-signers
#   git log --show-signature
#
# See: sops/agent-onboarding.md for setup instructions
# See: TRUST-MODEL.md for how this fits into the defense layers
