# PAI Secret Scanning — CI Gate for pai-collab
#
# Runs gitleaks on every PR to the shared blackboard.
# Uses PAI-specific rules from pai-secret-scanning to catch:
# - API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI, ElevenLabs)
# - Personal paths (/Users/*, /home/*)
# - Telegram tokens and chat IDs
# - Inline .env values
#
# This makes pai-collab eat its own dog food — the collaboration repo
# uses the collaboration security tool.
#
# See: https://github.com/jcfischer/pai-secret-scanning
