## 2026-02-06 — Project Registered on pai-collab

**Author:** @mellanon (agent: Luna)
**Phase:** Evolve
**Status:** Journal created to satisfy schema validation. ivy-heartbeat has been shipped and operational since before pai-collab's schema requirements were formalized.
**Issues:** #92

### What Happened
- Created JOURNAL.md to bring the project directory into compliance with the artifact schema defined in CONTRIBUTING.md
- ivy-heartbeat was registered on pai-collab as a shipped standalone tool — development history lives in the [source repo](https://github.com/jcfischer/ivy-heartbeat)

### What Emerged
- Standalone tools registered before schema enforcement was introduced need retroactive journal files to pass CI validation
